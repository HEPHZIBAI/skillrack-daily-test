/*
The program must accept an integer matrix of size RxC and an integer X (where X has occurred at least once in the matrix) as the input. The program must print all submatrices of size 2x2, containing the integer X at least once as shown in the Example Input/Output section.

Boundary Condition(s): 2 <= R C <= 50

1<= Matrix element value, X <= 1000

Input Format:

The first line contains R and C separated by a space. The next R lines each contain C integers separated by a space. The (R+2ynd line contains X

Output Format:

The lines contain the list of 2x2 submatrices containing the integer X as shown in the Example Input/Output section.

Example Input/Output 1:

Input

44

10 20 30 40

45 78 56 89

12 56 23 10

48 98 26 55

56

Output

20 30

78 56

30 40

56 89

45 78

12 56

78 56

56 23

56 89

23 10

12 56

48 98

56 23

98 26

Explanation:

Here X = 56. There are seven 2x2 submatrices containing the integer 56. So they are printed as the output.
