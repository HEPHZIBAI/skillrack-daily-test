'''
The program must accept a string S containing only alphabets as the input. The program must remove the repeated alphabets in the string S and print the modified string as the output.
Note: At least one unique alphabet is always present in the string S.

Boundary Condition(s):
	1 <= Length of S <= 1000

Input Format:
	The first line contains S.

Output Format:
	The first line contains the modified string S.

Example Input/Output 1:
	Input:
		engine
	Output: 
		gi
	Explanation:
		Here the string is engine,
		The alphabets e and n are repeated in the string engine, so they are removed from the string.
		Now the string becomes gi, so gi is printed as the output.

	Input:
		fireFighter
	Output:
		fFght
